This is the story of `<pfe-avatar>`.

Decentralized summons thoughts of blockchain.  This isn't that, except insofar as the avatars are a chain of colored blocks (pixels).  These avatars are decentralized only in a very loose sense, namely they are powered by a hash function, not a central database, and so users with identical usernames/IDs/etc will have identical avatars on isolated systems.
