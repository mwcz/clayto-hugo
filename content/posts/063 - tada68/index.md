It's been more than ten years since I first caught the mechanical keyboard bug.  Having been immersed in stories from computing's early days, such as [Hackers][hackers] and [Snow Crash][snowcrash], I became intrigued by the idea of bringing that old-school clack into my life.  Fast foward ten years, I've owned and enjoyed several boards, including Model M's (Unicomp era), Leopold, iKBC.

As with most hobbies, stick with them long enough and ones tastes will refine to an absurd degree.  Over time, I simply got tired of the keyboards I had.  Buckling spring switches made my fingers tired, Cherry browns' tactile bump was hardly there, and each board's stabilizers were a bit too rattly.  Even high-end prebuilt keyboards didn't excite me anymore.

That's when I discovered the custom mechanical keyboard community, mostly through [r/MechanicalKeyboards][rmk] and [Taeha Types][taeha].

## The Kit

For my first custom build, I bought the [Tada68 keyboard][tada68] kit from [KBDfans][kbdfans].  It seems the kit isn't listed on their website anymore, but it included:

 - a plastic case
 - a PCB
 - an aluminum plate
 - screws, rubber feet, and other bits and bobs

## The Switches

I'm a big fan of tactile switches!  Cherry browns were my previous favorite, but I wanted something with a more satisfying tactile bump, more like a tactile *thunk*.  After some research, I settled on [Zealios][zealio], and I'm glad I did.  These switches are fantastic; they're exactly what I was looking for.

Applying a small amount of lubricant to the inside of each switch eliminates unpleasant rattling noises.  It also makes the key presses feel smoother.  Without the lubricant, most Cherry-style switches feel a little bit scratchy.  It's subtle, but noticable when it's missing.

## The Stabilizers

The Tada68 kit came with some plate-mount stabilizers.  Enthusiasts tend to prefer stabilizers that screw into the PCB, rather than snap into the plate.  PCB screw-ins have a more solid fit and are unlikely to rattle.

## The Case

The case was made by [Kahn's Cuts][lxkhn].

However, while I was waiting on the wooden case to be completed, I went ahead and built the board with the stock plastic case.
