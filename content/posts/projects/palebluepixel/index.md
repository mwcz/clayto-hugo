[Pale Blue Pixel][9] is this blog. I write technical posts about web
development

- image processing
- amateur graphics
- and generally celebrating the
  art and craft of programming. The name _Pale Blue Pixel_ is a meek tribute to
  Carl Sagan's [Pale Blue Dot][pbd].

It's currently powered by:

- **[Python][2]** - a large and powerful snake
- **[Pelican][3]** - an awkwardly-shaped sea bird
- **CSS Grid** - framework-free CSS thanks to grid and flexbox
- **[LESS][5]** - CSS preprocessor
- **[GitHub pages][7]** - hosting
