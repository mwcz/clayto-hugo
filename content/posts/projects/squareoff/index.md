Square Off is a 1v1 airhockey-style game that [Jared][jared] and [I][mwcz]
built in 72 hours for the [Ludum Dare 35][ld35] game jam. And beacuse it's
web-based, you can...

.sqoff-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 10px;
}
</style>

We were both very happy with how the game turned out, especially since this was
our first game jam. Our fellow game creators were nice enough to give us some
[pretty good ratings][ld35-sqoff], too. Square Off placed 199th overall out of
2,712 games. Our best scores were in the FUN category where we placed 64th.

In other words, Square Off placed in the _97.6th percentile of fun!_

Our mad 72-hour dash is documented in this [retrospective][retro] on the
[Scripta blog][scripta].
