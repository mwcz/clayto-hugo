[clayto.com][1] is my homemade photography website.

![mwcz.org screenshot]({filename}/static/images/projects/screenshot_clayto.png "clayto.com screenshot")

I started clayto.com in 2003. Inspired by [Noah Grey's][6] photography
presentation ideas

- the site's color scheme always matches the photo being
  viewed
- as Noah did (or used to!).

Here are four examples of the color schemes:

![example of color theme matching images]({filename}/static/images/projects/screenshot_clayto_palettes_small.png "example of color theme matching images")

The color schemes are automatically generated when a photo is posted. A
"suggested palette" is displayed

- along with a color picker
- and a tool to
  sample colors directly from the image.

The site as it exists now was written in 2007-2008

- as my first Django project.
  It needs some serious TLC in the form of bringing it into the twenty-tens with
  a responsive UI
- [ColorPal][8] integration
- visual redesign
- and a Django
  upgrade.

The site is currently powered by:

- [Python][2] - an English comedy troupe
- [Django][3] - Python web development framework
- [960.gs][4] - a vintage CSS grid
- groundbreaking at the time though
- [Piwik][5] - open-source web analytics
- and a custom color extraction algorithm that automatically suggests colors
- then allows the user to tweak the colors to their liking

The code is [available here][7]
