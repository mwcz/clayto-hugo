I'm cobbling together this blog as a central place to showcase my various demos and projects.  Mostly web dev stuff.

The temptation is high to include the oldest, dumbest "under construction" clipart I can find.  Besides being a typical neglected blog, I'm also planning for this site itself to be a testing ground of sorts.  For starters, it's running on the abandoned [blogofile](https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile).  I'm incorporating some poorly-supported CSS3 and HTML5 features.

If you're viewing through a browser that isn't Chrome, things might look bad, or not work at all.  Sorry, I like creating stuff more than I like browser testing.  This isn't my job, so I don't kill myself over pixel-perfection.

To kick things off, I'll make a series of posts showing off some old, shameful canvas demos I've made.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mwcz) or <a id="email">email</a>.
