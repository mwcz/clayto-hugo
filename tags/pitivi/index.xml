      <description>My first experience with PiTiVi, eight years ago, was discouraging. Until my dad rediscovered it a few days ago, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of giving it a second chance. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely impressed with the improvements. PiTiVi&amp;rsquo;s formerly rough edges have been sanded down, and what remains is an approachable, capable video editor perfectly suited to hobbyist uses.
One of the few remaining rough edges is low-quality defaults when it comes to rendering quality.</description>
