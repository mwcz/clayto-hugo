      <description>I have someone I&amp;rsquo;d like you to meet. SimPixel, meet everyone. Everyone, SimPixel.
SimPixel, introduce yourself SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam and Dan build over at Maniacal Labs.
Very much alike. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably so much like their displays because I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam&amp;rsquo;s workbench. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, there could be a connection. If you too would like to take a seat at Adam&amp;rsquo;s illustrious workbench someday, hack away.</description>
