      <title>PiTiVi High Quality Rendering</title>

      <description>My first experience with PiTiVi, eight years ago, was discouraging. Until my dad rediscovered it a few days ago, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of giving it a second chance. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely impressed with the improvements. PiTiVi&amp;rsquo;s formerly rough edges have been sanded down, and what remains is an approachable, capable video editor perfectly suited to hobbyist uses.
One of the few remaining rough edges is low-quality defaults when it comes to rendering quality.</description>

      <description>The Minimic is great. I just received mine last week, and I&amp;rsquo;m loving the ability to join video calls with nice, comfy headphones. It&amp;rsquo;s much better than switching back and forth between headphones and a headset.
The only problem is that, since the minimic is just a wire, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any noise or echo cancellation. And since Fedora doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with that feature enabled by default, the mic was picking up a lot of ambient noise.</description>
