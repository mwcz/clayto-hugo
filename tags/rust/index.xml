      <description>took a cruise through prng packages. from rand, to wyhash+rand_core, to pure getrandom, and back to rand. might revisit wyhash later for performance, or pregenerate a list of random numbers (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bulk up .wasm filesize too much). returning Vec&amp;lt;Vec3&amp;gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t work, flattened to Vec, it was easier than  could have read more about js-sys to figure out how to return a uin8clampedarray, but just wanted to get it working.</description>

      <description>Two classes stand out as my favorites from computer science at NCSU: x86 assembly and computer graphics. In the graphics course, we wrote a rasterizer and a ray tracer (which I never finished ðŸ˜…).
In the 16 years since, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working happily in web development, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to lament losing touch with lower-level, nearer-metal (ðŸ¤˜) programming which captured my interest so much in college.
When I learned that my favorite CS lecturer, Dana Lasher, retired recently, I decided to start a fun side project in honor of him and the inspiration he gave me.</description>
