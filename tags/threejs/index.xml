      <description>I have someone I&amp;rsquo;d like you to meet. SimPixel, meet everyone. Everyone, SimPixel.
SimPixel, introduce yourself SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam and Dan build over at Maniacal Labs.
Very much alike. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably so much like their displays because I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam&amp;rsquo;s workbench. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, there could be a connection. If you too would like to take a seat at Adam&amp;rsquo;s illustrious workbench someday, hack away.</description>

      <description>Fireflies is a WebGL demo in which a friendly flock of fireflies forms shapes for your entertainment. Here are some live demo links, and a video.
  Thanks to Loren Schmidt for agreeing to let me use the awesome pixel-person avatar.

      <description>Tracer is a 3D connect-the-dots game that Jared and I created for Ludum Dare 37.
We were very happy with the ratings Tracer received. In the Innovation category, we placed 5th out of 1,489 games.
A more detailed blog post is available at the Scripta Games blog.

      <title>Kimotion at geekSPARK 2016</title>

      <description>Just a few short daysmonths ago, Kimotion was on display at SPARKcon. SPARKcon is a large art festival in Raleigh, and we occupy a small slice of it called geekSPARK.
Kimotion Levels Up Last year&amp;rsquo;s tech had a rudimentary and finicky hand tracking system. It was workable, but a lot of visitors had trouble using it, especially kids. This year, I added Leap Motion support, which was a huge&amp;hellip; jump forward for hand tracking.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Network Traffic with WebGL</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Finally,&amp;rdquo; I thought, &amp;ldquo;an excuse to play with WebGL at work!&amp;rdquo;
This year, I had the good fortune of contributing to a keynote presentation at Red Hat Summit. During the keynote, an audience of 5,000 played a mobile web game created by our team. The game was backed by several microservices which we modified on stage while the audience played.
My contribution was to display, in a visual and engaging way, the live network traffic flowing through our system.</description>

      <description>Kimotion is a framework for building reactive art displays.
Creating an interactive art exhibit with Kimotion is easy. Draw your ideas in either 2D or 3D. Kimotion will provide information about the scene, which you can use to influence your display.
Learn more at kimotion.xyz, or if you want to see it in action&amp;hellip;
Video clips These images, when played in rapid succession, create the illusion of motion!

      <description>A year ago, I had the joy of working on Digital Motion, an interactive art exhibit for Raleigh&amp;rsquo;s annual art festival, SPARKcon. The month leading up to SPARKcon 2014 was a mad dash of perfecting the graphics and physics equations of my DiMo: Particles display. After a wonderful weekend of watching visitors enjoy the weird things we made, a lesson began congealing itself in my mind.
Creating interactive art exhibits from scratch is really hard.</description>

      <title>DiMo: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars</title>
      <link>https://clayto.com/2014/10/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/</link>

      <description>Imagine a solitary blue dot.
Unless you let your imagination run away with itself, this is going to be a pretty boring dot. Now, imagine a second, larger dot (you can pick the color).
Red, nice choice! The scene is now slightly more interesting, since now you&amp;rsquo;ve got two dots to think about. You can ponder their positions, and relative sizes. No motion though; still pretty boring!
Pretty soon, your keen and restless mind will imagine that the larger dot exerts a gravitational pull on the smaller one.</description>

      <description>Dimo: Particles is an artistic particle physics simulation and interactive art exhibit I created (along with fellow Red Hat engineers Ian Hands and Ben Pritchett) for the SPARKcon festival in 2014.
Pictures These pictures are from the art exhibit at geekSPARK in 2014.

After the event, I wrote this opensource.com article about the experience.
The source code is, of course, open.</description>

      <description>A player walks up Fayetteville St in Raleigh, North Carolina. SPARKcon has begun, and dozens of artists are strewn along the street, hard at work creating elaborate chalk art on the asphalt. A light rain is falling, and some artists are holding umbrellas over their work, some have draped tarps over themselves and their sketches, but most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care, as if creating their art is more important than how long it lasts.</description>
