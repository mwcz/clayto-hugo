      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than ten years since I first caught the mechanical keyboard bug. Having been immersed in stories from computing&amp;rsquo;s early days, such as Hackers and Snow Crash, I became intrigued by the idea of bringing that old-school clack into my life. Fast foward ten years, I&amp;rsquo;ve owned and enjoyed several boards, including Model M&amp;rsquo;s (Unicomp era), Leopold, iKBC.
As with most hobbies, stick with them long enough and ones tastes will refine to an absurd degree.</description>
