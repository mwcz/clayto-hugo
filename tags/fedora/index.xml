      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a tale as old as time. A nice laptop. A nearby cold beverage. A sickening splash. Thanks to the solid seals on the Carbon, there was no permanent damage, just a very sticky, nearly unusable keyboard. Rather than clean or replace the keyboard, our support desk opted to issue a new laptop.
That&amp;rsquo;s how I found myself with two identical laptops, one whose SSD had a fully configured OS, and the other with an empty SSD in need of such an OS.</description>

      <description>The Minimic is great. I just received mine last week, and I&amp;rsquo;m loving the ability to join video calls with nice, comfy headphones. It&amp;rsquo;s much better than switching back and forth between headphones and a headset.
The only problem is that, since the minimic is just a wire, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any noise or echo cancellation. And since Fedora doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with that feature enabled by default, the mic was picking up a lot of ambient noise.</description>
