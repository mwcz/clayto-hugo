      <description>The East Coast Game Conference was a lot of fun! Jared and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.
Abstract  Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.
Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.</description>

      <description>Play now!  Three years ago, surrounded by monitors in a dark, blue-hued room, a particular screen caught my eye. My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s (now wife&amp;rsquo;s) eye was caught by the same screen, and we crossed the room to investigate.
We were visiting the Indie Game Revolution exhibit at EMP in Seattle, and what we found on that screen was Scene I, Act I of Kentucky Route Zero. It took me three years, but I finally rediscovered KR0 a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Play now!   Humanity, listen up. This is the Universe. I am sick of you sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. That’s why there’s a huge asteroid heading straight for your pitiful Earth, courtesy of yours truly. I see you’ve built a flimsy Barrier and a stockpile of Missiles, but it won’t help. Enjoy the end times! Bye-bye. Talk soon.
  – The Universe
  The weekend before Ludum Dare, I wrote a post about preparing for Ludum Dare 38.</description>

      <description>Square Off is a 1v1 airhockey-style game that Jared and I built in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 35 game jam. And beacuse it&amp;rsquo;s web-based, you can&amp;hellip;
Play now!   .sqoff-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)); grid-gap: 10px; }   We were both very happy with how the game turned out, especially since this was our first game jam. Our fellow game creators were nice enough to give us some pretty good ratings, too.</description>

      <description>Check out Ping! I created it for my team&amp;rsquo;s booth at Red Hat Summit 2015 (Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s huge annual conference), to promote Access Labs. It&amp;rsquo;s a 1-4 player pong clone with special powers.
It&amp;rsquo;s Web-based, so you can play it right this minute. Our booth had a quintet of USB gamepads, but your keyboard works just as well. Enjoy stomping the AI (instead of your fellow humans).
