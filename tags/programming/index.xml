      <title>Shaking Off the Rust 2: Ray Tracing in WebAssembly</title>

      <description>Rust. A ray tracer. The dream of WebAssembly. One dangerous idea that could ruin everything.
This was the scene at the end of my last post, which covered creating a ray tracer in Rust using Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s outstanding Ray Tracing in One Weekend. In the wrap-up to that post, I expressed an interest in creating a WebAssembly build of the ray tracer, and that project is what follows.
The process of targeting WebAssembly went well, overall.</description>

      <description>Two classes stand out as my favorites from computer science at NCSU: x86 assembly, taught by Dana Lasher, and computer graphics, taught by Stuart Heinrich. In the graphics course, we wrote a rasterizer and a ray tracer (which I never finished ðŸ˜…).
In the 16 years since, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working happily in web development, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to lament losing touch with lower-level, near-metal (ðŸ¤˜) programming which captured my interest so much in college.</description>

      <description>The East Coast Game Conference was a lot of fun! Jared and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.
Abstract  Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.
Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.</description>

      <description>Play now!  Three years ago, surrounded by monitors in a dark, blue-hued room, a particular screen caught my eye. My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s (now wife&amp;rsquo;s) eye was caught by the same screen, and we crossed the room to investigate.
We were visiting the Indie Game Revolution exhibit at EMP in Seattle, and what we found on that screen was Scene I, Act I of Kentucky Route Zero. It took me three years, but I finally rediscovered KR0 a few weeks ago.</description>

Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s a huge asteroid heading straight for your pitiful Earth, courtesy of yours truly. I see youâ€™ve built a flimsy Barrier and a stockpile of Missiles, but it wonâ€™t help. Enjoy the end times! Bye-bye. Talk soon.

 SimPixel, introduce yourself SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam and Dan build over at Maniacal Labs.
#mlabs { height: 50vh !important; } @media screen and (min-width: 660px) { #mlabs { float: right; margin-left: 20px; } }    Very much alike. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably so much like their displays because I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam&amp;rsquo;s workbench.</description>

      <description>Just a few short days months ago, Kimotion was on display at SPARKcon. SPARKcon is a large art festival in Raleigh, and we occupy a small slice of it called geekSPARK.
Kimotion Levels Up Last year&amp;rsquo;s tech had a rudimentary and finicky hand tracking system. It was workable, but a lot of visitors had trouble using it, especially kids. This year, I added Leap Motion support, which was a huge&amp;hellip; jump forward for hand tracking.</description>

      <description>They say good developers are lazy. A tedious process is no match for a lazy developer. Below is an experiment in laziness. It&amp;rsquo;s a proof of concept for using Web Components without having to manually import each one.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what to call it. It grazes the definitions of lazyloading, autoloading, and dependency injection, so I went with the laziest term.
Let&amp;rsquo;s set the scene, and find out if it&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile developer convenience, or ease-of-use gone mad&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Kimotion is a simple framework for creating interactive art exhibits in 2D or 3D and supports both Kinect and Leap Motion for viewer input. This tutorial will focus on the Leap, so to proceed with the tutorial you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set up your Leap.
Once the leap service is running, you can set up Kimotion!
Get the code git clone git@github.com:mwcz/Kimotion.git cd Kimotion  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use git, no problem, just download and extract the Kimotion zip file instead.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Finally,&amp;rdquo; I thought, &amp;ldquo;an excuse to play with WebGL at work!&amp;rdquo;
This year, I had the good fortune of contributing to a keynote presentation at Red Hat Summit. During the keynote, an audience of 5,000 played a mobile web game created by our team. The game was backed by several microservices which we modified on stage while the audience played.
My contribution was to display, in a visual and engaging way, the live network traffic flowing through our system.</description>

      <description>A year ago, I had the joy of working on Digital Motion, an interactive art exhibit for Raleigh&amp;rsquo;s annual art festival, SPARKcon. The month leading up to SPARKcon 2014 was a mad dash of perfecting the graphics and physics equations of my DiMo: Particles display. After a wonderful weekend of watching visitors enjoy the weird things we made, a lesson began congealing itself in my mind.
Creating interactive art exhibits from scratch is really hard.</description>

      <description>There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.   Phil Karlton, but I can&#39;t find a name for the original source...    Contriving names for things is so commonplace for computer programmers that we may be thinking up names more often than any other profession. Every day, usually dozens of times, I find myself trying to imagine the perfect name for a function or variable or module.</description>

      <description>Imagine a solitary blue dot.
Unless you let your imagination run away with itself, this is going to be a pretty boring dot. Now, imagine a second, larger dot (you can pick the color).
Red, nice choice! The scene is now slightly more interesting, since now you&amp;rsquo;ve got two dots to think about. You can ponder their positions, and relative sizes. No motion though; still pretty boring!
Pretty soon, your keen and restless mind will imagine that the larger dot exerts a gravitational pull on the smaller one.</description>

      <description>A player walks up Fayetteville St in Raleigh, North Carolina. SPARKcon has begun, and dozens of artists are strewn along the street, hard at work creating elaborate chalk art on the asphalt. A light rain is falling, and some artists are holding umbrellas over their work, some have draped tarps over themselves and their sketches, but most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care, as if creating their art is more important than how long it lasts.</description>
