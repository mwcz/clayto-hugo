      <description>&amp;ldquo;Finally,&amp;rdquo; I thought, &amp;ldquo;an excuse to play with WebGL at work!&amp;ldquo;
This year, I had the good fortune of contributing to a keynote presentation at Red Hat Summit. During the keynote, an audience of 5,000 played a mobile web game created by our team. The game was backed by several microservices which we modified on stage while the audience played.
My contribution was to display, in a visual and engaging way, the live network traffic flowing through our system.</description>

      <description>Check out Ping! I created it for my team&amp;rsquo;s booth at Red Hat Summit 2015 (Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s huge annual conference), to promote Access Labs. It&amp;rsquo;s a 1-4 player pong clone with special powers.
It&amp;rsquo;s Web-based, so you can play it right this minute. Our booth had a quintet of USB gamepads, but your keyboard works just as well. Enjoy stomping the AI (instead of your fellow humans).
