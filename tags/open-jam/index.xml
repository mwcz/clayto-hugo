      <description>The East Coast Game Conference was a lot of fun! Jared and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.
Abstract  Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.
Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.</description>
