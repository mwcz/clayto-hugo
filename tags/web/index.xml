      <description>The East Coast Game Conference was a lot of fun! Jared and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.
Abstract  Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.
Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.</description>

      <description>Play now!  Three years ago, surrounded by monitors in a dark, blue-hued room, a particular screen caught my eye. My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s (now wife&amp;rsquo;s) eye was caught by the same screen, and we crossed the room to investigate.
We were visiting the Indie Game Revolution exhibit at EMP in Seattle, and what we found on that screen was Scene I, Act I of Kentucky Route Zero. It took me three years, but I finally rediscovered KR0 a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Play now!   Humanity, listen up. This is the Universe. I am sick of you sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. That’s why there’s a huge asteroid heading straight for your pitiful Earth, courtesy of yours truly. I see you’ve built a flimsy Barrier and a stockpile of Missiles, but it won’t help. Enjoy the end times! Bye-bye. Talk soon.

 SimPixel, introduce yourself SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam and Dan build over at Maniacal Labs.
#mlabs { height: 50vh !important; } @media screen and (min-width: 660px) { #mlabs { float: right; margin-left: 20px; } }    Very much alike. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably so much like their displays because I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam&amp;rsquo;s workbench.</description>

Kimotion Levels Up Last year&amp;rsquo;s tech had a rudimentary and finicky hand tracking system. It was workable, but a lot of visitors had trouble using it, especially kids. This year, I added Leap Motion support, which was a huge&amp;hellip; jump forward for hand tracking.</description>

      <description>Kimotion is a simple framework for creating interactive art exhibits in 2D or 3D and supports both Kinect and Leap Motion for viewer input. This tutorial will focus on the Leap, so to proceed with the tutorial you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set up your Leap.
Once the leap service is running, you can set up Kimotion!
Get the code git clone git@github.com:mwcz/Kimotion.git cd Kimotion  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use git, no problem, just download and extract the Kimotion zip file instead.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Finally,&amp;rdquo; I thought, &amp;ldquo;an excuse to play with WebGL at work!&amp;rdquo;
This year, I had the good fortune of contributing to a keynote presentation at Red Hat Summit. During the keynote, an audience of 5,000 played a mobile web game created by our team. The game was backed by several microservices which we modified on stage while the audience played.
My contribution was to display, in a visual and engaging way, the live network traffic flowing through our system.</description>

      <description>A year ago, I had the joy of working on Digital Motion, an interactive art exhibit for Raleigh&amp;rsquo;s annual art festival, SPARKcon. The month leading up to SPARKcon 2014 was a mad dash of perfecting the graphics and physics equations of my DiMo: Particles display. After a wonderful weekend of watching visitors enjoy the weird things we made, a lesson began congealing itself in my mind.
Creating interactive art exhibits from scratch is really hard.</description>

Since that&amp;rsquo;s been covered, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about one impact wasm will hopefully have on future of computing. To set the scene, a quote from the man himself:
 Meanwhile, I took one quick step that would demonstrate the concept of the Web as a universal, all-encompassing space.</description>

Phil Karlton, but I can&#39;t find a name for the original source...    Contriving names for things is so commonplace for computer programmers that we may be thinking up names more often than any other profession. Every day, usually dozens of times, I find myself trying to imagine the perfect name for a function or variable or module.</description>

      <description>Imagine a solitary blue dot.
Unless you let your imagination run away with itself, this is going to be a pretty boring dot. Now, imagine a second, larger dot (you can pick the color).
Red, nice choice! The scene is now slightly more interesting, since now you&amp;rsquo;ve got two dots to think about. You can ponder their positions, and relative sizes. No motion though; still pretty boring!
Pretty soon, your keen and restless mind will imagine that the larger dot exerts a gravitational pull on the smaller one.</description>

SPARKcon has begun, and dozens of artists are strewn along the street, hard at work creating elaborate chalk art on the asphalt. A light rain is falling, and some artists are holding umbrellas over their work, some have draped tarps over themselves and their sketches, but most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care, as if creating their art is more important than how long it lasts.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, a coworker of mine ran into some font issues. Firefox doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow cross-origin requests for web fonts, and he was using a tool called Font Squirrel to generate fonts, including data URIs.
Embedding a data URI for a font (or image) inside a CSS file is a common technique for reducing the number of HTTP requests. In this case, it also negates the need for a cross-domain request to fetch the font file, because the file&amp;rsquo;s contents are already embedded.</description>

      <description>Hi pals.
This is a speedy post about a speedy update I made today to ColorPal, an HTML5 tool I wrote that automatically generates color palettes from a photograph.
Previously, ColorPal provided hex codes for each color extracted from the image. Eight individual &amp;lt;input&amp;gt;s at the bottom of the page displayed the colors.
I use ColorPal a lot (my own dogfood and all that) when designing websites, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I got fed up (hah!</description>

      <description>2018-08-29 update: This is an old post about how I created a thin indexed color API in front of HTML5 canvas. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t very usable or powerful, but it was a fun learning experience. Instead of reading the post, I recommend checking out Mark Ferrari&amp;rsquo;s breathtaking color cycling art. from 90s adventure games.
 First, I converted the classic SVG tiger into a set of canvas drawing instructions using Professor Cloud&amp;rsquo;s conversion tool.</description>

      <description>In my last post on the subject, I introduced ColorPal, my HTML5 color palette generation tool. It didn&amp;rsquo;t perform well with certain types of images, so I fixed it. :)
 
Color palettes will now match the image even better. Especially for images with infrequent but important colors. Here&amp;rsquo;s a comparison of the old and new methods, on an image that is mostly black:
You can see that with the old method, the black pixels definitely took over the palette.</description>

      <description>Introducing ColorPal!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with color palette generation for years. My photography website has always had some form of dynamic palette, so the theme of each page matches the photo. You can see the current iteration here:
 I owe the idea of photo-matching website palettes to Noah Grey. Each iteration of my photo site has gotten a slightly more advanced palette generation tool. You can see murmurs of them in the old canvas demos I&amp;rsquo;ve posted.</description>

      <description>How to ruin a good thing by abusing CSS3 text shadows&amp;hellip;
 CSS3!
The code:
// Random factors to determine x/y offsets for text shadows and amount of blur var x_factor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) - 10; var y_factor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) - 10; var blur_factor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // Pretty colors var the_colors = [ &amp;#34;#7f9f7f&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#dca3a3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#80d4aa&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#f8f893&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#ffcfaf&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#e89393&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#9ece9e&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#c0bed1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#6c6c9c&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#71d3b4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#a0afa0&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#efefef&amp;#34; ]; function make_it() { // MAKE IT SHINE  // Build a string containing a comma-delimited list of the each shadow we want to apply  // sprintf would be nice here.</description>

      <title>HTML5 canvas point operations</title>

      <description>This is the last demo I made using JSImage. I created it some time around 2009-2010. At the time, I had checked out an imaging book from my university&amp;rsquo;s library at least ten times. Most of the exercises in that book I implemented in Python using PIL, but point operations were simple enough to port to JavaScript quickly.
Point operations are image alterations that affect all pixels equally. Other operations, like blurring for example, each result pixel depends on adjacent pixels.</description>

      <description>For an HCI class project in Fall 2009, I pulled together some of my previous demos to make this integrated tool. It was just a prototype, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to get the code set up and working on this blog. If anyone is interested, I can dig up the code and send it along.
  In retrospect, it really could have used some narration&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>HTML5 canvas 3D pixel array</title>

      <description>This is another demo from 2009-ish. When I started experimenting with canvas, I felt uncomfortable with the 1-dimensionality of CanvasPixelArray. I wrote this script to convert it into a more logical format: X by Y by RGBA. Let me rephrase that. By &amp;ldquo;more logical&amp;rdquo;, I mean &amp;ldquo;more logical, to me, at the time). 1D is fine, and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any use for this script. But, nonetheless, here it is, including the original description.</description>

      <title>HTML5 canvas area selection averaging</title>

      <guid>https://clayto.com/2011/11/html5-canvas-area-selection-averaging/</guid>
      <description>This is a demo from late 2009. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension of the single-pixel eyedropper I wrote previously.
It&amp;rsquo;s powered by an early version of an old JS toolkit I wrote called JSImage. The latest version is available at my JSImage github repo. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the 2011 commits, those are just artifacts from svn-&amp;gt;git migration. No guarantees that the histo&amp;rsquo;s are actually correct. :)
Click and drag to set the image border to the average of the selected pixels.</description>

      <description>This is yet another demo from around 2009. It&amp;rsquo;s simple enough. Click a button, draw an unbinned RGB histogram of the source image.
It&amp;rsquo;s powered by an early version of an old JS toolkit I wrote called JSImage. The latest version is available at my JSImage github repo. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the 2011 commits, those are just artifacts from svn-&amp;gt;git migration. No guarantees that the histo&amp;rsquo;s are actually correct. :)</description>

      <title>Opcode patterns 70% finished</title>

      <description>genlut.py is really filling out. It generates the LUT for all 68k opcodes (68000 only), and I&amp;rsquo;m about 70% done. 77 down, 34 to go.
The OPCODES dict defines the first two bytes of each opcode, both static bits and operands. The operand strings act as keys into the PATTERNS struct, which contains all possible values for each operand.
The recursive function gen() is fed an opcode pattern which may contain operand strings as well as static bits.</description>

      <description>Decoding is easy. Decoding requires a lot of typing. (I am starting to believe this is true of ever aspect of interpreted emulation&amp;hellip;)
For the AEJS decoder, I am creating a look-up table with every possible pattern for each instruction. It was my first idea, but I initially discarded it as &amp;ldquo;wasteful and inelegant&amp;rdquo;. Later, I accepted it as &amp;ldquo;really fast&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m generating a large set of bit patterns that map to 68k opcodes, like so:</description>

      <title>Introducing AEJS</title>

      <description>Introducing AEJS, an Amiga emulator written in JavaScript. Wait, wording it like that makes it sound like it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It isn&amp;rsquo;t. It won&amp;rsquo;t be for a long time. AEJS is just a hobby, and will never hold a candle to UAE.
Why the Amiga? Given that this is my first emulator, it would have been much easier to go with a 6502 or 8080 instead, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up with those; I grew up with a 68k powering an Amiga 500.</description>
