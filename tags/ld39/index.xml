      <description>Play now!  Three years ago, surrounded by monitors in a dark, blue-hued room, a particular screen caught my eye. My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s (now wife&amp;rsquo;s) eye was caught by the same screen, and we crossed the room to investigate.
We were visiting the Indie Game Revolution exhibit at EMP in Seattle, and what we found on that screen was Scene I, Act I of Kentucky Route Zero. It took me three years, but I finally rediscovered KR0 a few weeks ago.</description>
