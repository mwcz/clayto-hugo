      <description>The Minimic is great. I just received mine last week, and I&amp;rsquo;m loving the ability to join video calls with nice, comfy headphones. It&amp;rsquo;s much better than switching back and forth between headphones and a headset.
The only problem is that, since the minimic is just a wire, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any noise or echo cancellation. And since Fedora doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with that feature enabled by default, the mic was picking up a lot of ambient noise.</description>
