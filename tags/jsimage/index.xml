      <description>This is the last demo I made using JSImage. I created it some time around 2009-2010. At the time, I had checked out an imaging book from my university&amp;rsquo;s library at least ten times. Most of the exercises in that book I implemented in Python using PIL, but point operations were simple enough to port to JavaScript quickly.
Point operations are image alterations that affect all pixels equally. Other operations, like blurring for example, each result pixel depends on adjacent pixels.</description>

      <title>HTML5 canvas RGB histogram</title>

      <description>This is yet another demo from around 2009. It&amp;rsquo;s simple enough. Click a button, draw an unbinned RGB histogram of the source image.
It&amp;rsquo;s powered by an early version of an old JS toolkit I wrote called JSImage. The latest version is available at my JSImage github repo. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the 2011 commits, those are just artifacts from svn-&amp;gt;git migration. No guarantees that the histo&amp;rsquo;s are actually correct.</description>

      <description>This is a demo from late 2009. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension of the single-pixel eyedropper I wrote previously.

Click and drag to set the image border to the average of the selected pixels.</description>
