      <description>I have someone I&amp;rsquo;d like you to meet. SimPixel, meet everyone. Everyone, SimPixel.
SimPixel, introduce yourself SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam and Dan build over at Maniacal Labs.
Very much alike. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably so much like their displays because I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam&amp;rsquo;s workbench. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, there could be a connection. If you too would like to take a seat at Adam&amp;rsquo;s illustrious workbench someday, hack away.</description>

      <description>Fireflies is a WebGL demo in which a friendly flock of fireflies forms shapes for your entertainment. Here are some live demo links, and a video.
  Thanks to Loren Schmidt for agreeing to let me use the awesome pixel-person avatar.

      <description>Kimotion is a framework for building reactive art displays.
Creating an interactive art exhibit with Kimotion is easy. Draw your ideas in either 2D or 3D. Kimotion will provide information about the scene, which you can use to influence your display.
Learn more at kimotion.xyz, or if you want to see it in action&amp;hellip;
Video clips These images, when played in rapid succession, create the illusion of motion!

      <title>DiMo: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars</title>
      <link>https://clayto.com/2014/10/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/</link>

      <description>Imagine a solitary blue dot.
Unless you let your imagination run away with itself, this is going to be a pretty boring dot. Now, imagine a second, larger dot (you can pick the color).
Red, nice choice! The scene is now slightly more interesting, since now you&amp;rsquo;ve got two dots to think about. You can ponder their positions, and relative sizes. No motion though; still pretty boring!
Pretty soon, your keen and restless mind will imagine that the larger dot exerts a gravitational pull on the smaller one.</description>

      <description>Dimo: Particles is an artistic particle physics simulation and interactive art exhibit I created (along with fellow Red Hat engineers Ian Hands and Ben Pritchett) for the SPARKcon festival in 2014.
Pictures These pictures are from the art exhibit at geekSPARK in 2014.

After the event, I wrote this opensource.com article about the experience.
The source code is, of course, open.</description>

      <title>Particles and Ï€ - DiMo Comes to Life</title>

      <description>A player walks up Fayetteville St in Raleigh, North Carolina. SPARKcon has begun, and dozens of artists are strewn along the street, hard at work creating elaborate chalk art on the asphalt. A light rain is falling, and some artists are holding umbrellas over their work, some have draped tarps over themselves and their sketches, but most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care, as if creating their art is more important than how long it lasts.</description>

      <title>RGB WebGL Color Cube</title>
      <link>https://clayto.com/2014/03/rgb-webgl-color-cube/</link>

      <guid>https://clayto.com/2014/03/rgb-webgl-color-cube/</guid>
      <description>I spent a bit of time this weekend building an RGB color cube for ColorPal, using Three.js. Drag and drop any image, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a cube with all the pixels of your image mapped into 3D space.
Launch live demo!and view the code.
Your web browser must support WebGL, which at this point in history means a fairly recent Firefox or Chrome. In case your web browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t support WebGL, here&amp;rsquo;s a video to enjoy while you download Firefox Nightly.</description>

      <description>ColorPal is an HTML5 color palette generator. Here&amp;rsquo;s a gif demonstrating how to use ColorPal. The color quality in gifs is pretty terrible, but you can still see the basic usage.
Try it out at colorpal.org.
ColorPal also has a command-line interface, powered by Node.js.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written some posts about ColorPal.</description>

      <title>Bouncey - canvas physics</title>
      <link>https://clayto.com/2011/11/bouncey-canvas-physics/</link>

      <guid>https://clayto.com/2011/11/bouncey-canvas-physics/</guid>
      <description>This is Bouncey. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple physics demo I wrote in early/mid 2011, with some contributions and bugfixes from my good friend Greg Gardner.
The description for bouncey&amp;rsquo;s github repo is:
&amp;quot;a buggy, rudimentary, just-for-fun javascript physics simulator.&amp;ldquo;It covers Newton&amp;rsquo;s laws of motion.
PauseAn updated (but less colorful) version of bouncey is available here.</description>
